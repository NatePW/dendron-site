## Details

**{{fm.title}}** is a command that lets you merge the content of your active note into another note of your choice.
When merged, the entire body of the source note is appended to the end of the destination note.
Also, all backlinks that the source note had will be updated so that it points to the merge destination, and finally the source note will be deleted.
